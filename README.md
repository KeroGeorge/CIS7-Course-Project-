# Vigenère Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program

## Project Description
This program implements the Vigenère Cipher, a classical encryption algorithm that uses a keyword to encrypt and decrypt messages. 
## Programming Approach
The program is written in C++ and employs a simple yet effective approach for the encryption and decryption of text using the Vigenère Cipher. The core steps are as follows:
1. **Key Sanitization:** The key is sanitized by removing any non-alphabetic characters and converting it to uppercase for consistency.
2. **Encryption:** Each character of the plaintext is shifted based on the corresponding character in the key.
3. **Decryption:** The reverse of encryption is applied to retrieve the original message.
4. **User Interaction:** The program prompts the user for their message, desired action (encryption or decryption), and displays the result.

### Key Features:
- Encrypt and decrypt text using the Vigenère Cipher.
- Input text is processed to handle case insensitivity and special characters.
- The program supports multiple messages for encryption/decryption.
